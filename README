== What is natto?

natto provides a Ruby binding with MeCab, 
the part-of-speech and morphological analyzer 
for the Japanese language.

== Try It! Try It!

natto requires the following:
* {http://sourceforge.net/projects/mecab/files/mecab/ MeCab 0.98}

* Ruby 1.8.7 or greater

=== Installation
Install natto with the following gem command:
* <code>gem install natto</code>

=== Configuration
* natto will try to locate the <tt>mecab</tt> library based upon its runtime environment.
* In case of <tt>LoadError</tt>, please set the <tt>MECAB_PATH</tt> environment variable to the exact name/path to your <tt>mecab</tt> library.

== Contributing to natto
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you must have your own version, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
